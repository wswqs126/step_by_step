1. 【ios】 RCTBridge required dispatch_sync to load RCTAppState

这个问题是加完启动页后出现的，但重新构建ok，没有特别调整。   

2. [ios] No bundle URL present. 
Make sure you're running a packager server or have included a .jsbundle file in your application bundle.   

一般是因为同时开启了 ios 和 安卓 remote debug 或者运行在同一个命令行窗口，关掉重新启动；或者手动关闭了terminal，总之连不上调试服务器了，而服务器是通过terminal控制，冲突或者关闭都连不上。       

3. [android] Error type 3 Error: Activity class {} does not exist   

> 上面四个都是环境问题，所以，不要说什么网上有诸多教程，还是要自己总结下。   

4. [third-party: 'config.h' file not found](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14382)

@Ignigena 的方法ok：

Running into the same issue here after upgrading from `0.44`. None of the above solutions or clearing caches did the trick for me. Here's what I did to get things working again:

In the Terminal, navigate to the `react-native/third-party/glog` folder inside `node_modules` (for me, this was `cd node_modules/react-native/third-party/glog-0.3.4`)
Once actively in this folder, run `../../scripts/ios-configure-glog.sh`
Glog is configured and the required `config.h` header file is created for Xcode to find

5. 'React' must be in scope when using JSX (react/react-in-jsx-scope)

一般是忘记引入依赖 `React`：   

```js
import React from 'react';
```

6. Component should be written as a pure function (react/prefer-stateless-function)

不知道 app.js 中的 ReduxRoute 哪里不纯？

7. React Native fetch() Network Request Failed


The problem here was that iOS does not allow http requests by default, only https. If you want to enable http requests add this to your info.plist:

```html
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

Q: Is it at all possible to update and object's properties with setState?

something like:

```js
this.state = {
    jasper: { name: 'jasper', age: 28 },
}
```
I have tried:   

`this.setState({jasper.name : 'someOtherName'});`

and this:   

`this.setState({jasper:{name:'someothername'}})`

The first is Syntax error and the second just does nothing. Any ideas?   
   
A:    

There are multiple ways of doing this.

1- Simplest one:

First create a copy of jasper then do the changes in that:

```js
let jasper = Object.assign({}, this.state.jasper);    //creating copy of object
jasper.name = 'someothername';                        //updating value
this.setState({jasper});
Instead of using Object.assign we can also write it like this:

let jasper = {...this.state.jasper};

```   

2- Using spread operator:

```js
this.setState(prevState => ({
    jasper: {
        ...prevState.jasper,
        name: 'something'
    }
}))
```

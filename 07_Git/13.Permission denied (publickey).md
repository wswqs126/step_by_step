GitHub isn't able to authenticate you. So, either you aren't setup with an SSH key, because you haven't [set one up on your machine](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/), or your key isn't associated with your GitHub account.

查看当前关联的账号信息：

```bash
ssh-add -l
```

关联当前账号信息
```bash
# 这里是添加的是私钥
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_activehacker
```
